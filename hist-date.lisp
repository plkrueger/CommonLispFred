Unfortunately, standard Common Lisp dates can only represent dates after Jan 1, 1900. Since many
historical data series have values that precede this date, we need to use an alternative representation.
It would always be possible to simple use string values, but for computational purposes (i.e. comparing
dates and computing differences between dates) a better representation is desirable.

This file implements such a package. Basically dates are represented as an integer that encodes a
date as a day-number (with day 0 being March 1, 0000) left shifted by 17 bits (i.e. multiplying by 131072)
plus the number of seconds in the time of day. This makes dates numerically comparable (i.e. later dates
are > than earlier dates).

Methods are provided to construct and print such dates and to do various sorts
of useful computation on them. Time zones are ignored so it is not possible to compare times around the
world. Daylight saving time is also ignored.

This uses algorithms for the Gregorian calendar, so no dates prior to October 1, 1582 can be representd
accurately. You can physically encode dates as early as March 1, 0000, but the day of week computation for
dates earlier than October 1, 1582 will be incorrect, as will date differences. No checks are done to see
that dates are within the range of the Gregorian calendar.

Computations assume that every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years
that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible
by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the year 2000 is.

Functions are also provided to convert between this data format and standard common lisp dates whenever
that is possible (i.e. for dates after Jan 1, 1900).
